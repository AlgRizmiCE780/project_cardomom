# üåø Cardamom Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This repository presents a deep learning project focused on classifying cardamom plant diseases using advanced CNN architectures (EfficientNet and ResNet). The dataset was collected in collaboration with the Indian Cardamom Research Institute (ICRI), Mayladumpara, Idukki, over a span of 65 days during summer.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Due to data-sharing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. The project is strictly for academic and research purposes.

## üì∏ Dataset Overview

The dataset was built from real-world field images captured under expert supervision from ICRI. It consists of three classes:
- **Healthy**
- **Leaf Blight**
- **Leaf Spot**

**Data Collection Duration:** 65 days  
**Conditions:** Outdoor summer lighting  
**Preprocessing Techniques:**  
- Image normalization  
- Augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)  
- Stratified train-validation split  
- Label encoding and resizing to uniform dimensions
