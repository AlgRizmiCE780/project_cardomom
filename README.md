# Cardamom Disease Classification using EfficientNet & ResNet

This repository presents a deep learning project focused on classifying diseases in cardamom plants using EfficientNet and ResNet architectures. The models are trained on a curated dataset in collaboration with scientists at ICRI Idukki.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: Due to data-sharing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. Usage of this project is restricted to academic purposes only.
